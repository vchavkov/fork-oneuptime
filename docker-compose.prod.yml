# Images are pushed to both Docker Hub and Github Container Registry. If you're using Github Container Registry, you can change the image tag to use the Github Container Registry.
# For example, if you want to use the image from Github Container Registry, you can change the image tag from oneuptime/dashboard:latest to ghcr.io/oneuptime/dashboard:latest

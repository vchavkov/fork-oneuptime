# Synthetic Monitor

Synthetic monitoring is a way to proactively monitor your applications by simulating user interactions. You can create a synthetic monitor to check the availability and performance of your applications from different locations around the world.

#### Example

The following example shows how to use a Synthetic Monitor:

```javascript
// You can use axios module, and page object from Playwright here.
// Page Object is a class that represents a single page in a browser.

await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');

// Playwright Documentation here: https://playwright.dev/docs/intro

// Here are some of the variables that you can use in the context of the monitored object:

console.log(browserType) // This will list the browser type in the current run context - Chromium, Firefox, Webkit

console.log(screenSizeType) // This will list the screen size type in the current run context - Mobile, Tablet, Desktop

// Playwright page object belongs to that specific browser context, so you can use it to interact with the browser.

// To take screenshots,

const screenshots = {};

screenshots['screenshot-name'] = await page.screenshot(); // you can save multiple screenshots and have them with different names.

// when you want to return a value, use return statement with data as a prop. You can also add screenshots in the screenshots array.

// To log data, use console.log
// console.log('Hello World');

return {
    data: 'Hello World',
    screenshots: screenshots
};
```

### Use of Playwright

We use Playwright to simulate user interactions. You can use Playwright `page` object to interact with the browser and perform actions like clicking buttons, filling forms, and taking screenshots.

### Screenshots

You can take screenshots of the page at any point in the script. You can take multiple screenshots and return them in the screenshots array. These screenshots will be available in the CBS Uptime Dashboard for that specific monitor.

```javascript

// To take screenshots,

const screenshots = {};

screenshots['screenshot-name'] = await page.screenshot();

return {
    data: 'Hello World',
    screenshots: screenshots
};

```

### Things to consider

- You only have `page` object available in the context of the script. This is from Playwright Page class. You can use it to run all the interactions with the browser.
- You can use `console.log` to log the data in the console. This will be available in the logs section of the monitor.
- You can return the data from the script using the `return` statement. You can also return screenshots in the screenshots array.
- You can use `browserType` and `screenSizeType` variables to get the browser type and screen size type in the current run context. Feel free to use them in your script if you like.
- This is a JavaScript script, so you can use all the JavaScript features in the script.
- You can use `axios` module to make HTTP requests in the script. You can use it to make API calls from the script.
- If you are using oneuptime.com, you will always have the latest version of Playwright & browsers available in the context of the script. If you're self-hosting, please make sure you update the probes to have the latest version of Playwright and the browsers.
- Timeout for the script is 2 minutes. If the script takes more than 2 mins, it will be terminated.

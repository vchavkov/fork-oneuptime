    <h1>CCPA</h1>

    <p>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</p>


</header>

<section>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>The CCPA is a new data privacy law that applies to businesses that collect personal information from California
        residents. The new law gives California residents new data privacy rights.
        <br /><br />
        CBS Uptime (Bosch, Inc.) strongly believes that customers should be able to control their data and trust that
        their information is protected when stored with our service. To support this, CBS Uptime holds itself to strict data
        security and privacy standards, including compliance with the CCPA.
    </p>

    <h3> Readiness Report</h3>


    <p>The California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, extends California consumers’ privacy rights by giving those
        consumers more control over their personal information.

        The CCPA takes effect on January 1, 2020, and CBS Uptime is on it.</p>

    <p> PROTECTING YOUR DATA</p>
    <p> CBS Uptime does not and will not buy or sell personal information. Our business is built on providing world-class
        monitoring, analytics, and on-call management for your resources and for your team; not on re-selling or
        enriching the data we collect.</p>

    <p> PROVIDING NEW RIGHTS & REQUESTS</p>
    <p> The CCPA gives California consumers new rights over their personal information. This includes the right to
        access personal information, the right to have personal information deleted, and the right to control the
        sale of personal information to third parties.</p>

    <p> MEETING CCPA REQUIREMENTS FOR CONSUMERS</p>
    <p> CBS Uptime’s API integrations allow you to meet consumers’ requests for access. Using our APIs, you can
        delete personal information, understand the categories of data collected, and get copies of the data
        CBS Uptime has processed on your behalf.</p>

    <p>HELPING YOU MEET YOUR COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS</p>
    <p>CBS Uptime is prepared and able to help you meet your CCPA compliance obligations. When you use
        CBS Uptime to collect or process personal information, CBS Uptime acts as a “service provider” and is
        prepared to sign a contractual addendum that cements our role.</p>

    <p>OPTION TO OPT-IN OR OUT</p>
    <p> CBS Uptime’s opt-in/opt-out features allow you to meet your privacy obligations by not tracking or
        collecting information from users who have opted out of tracking or collection.</p>

    <p> CUSTOM DATA COLLECTION</p>
    <p> CBS Uptime’s implementation features allow you to customize the data you collect from your
        users so you can limit the amount of personal information you collect (or not collect any at
        all). </p>

    <p> STRONG ENCRYPTION</p>
    <p>CBS Uptime applies cryptographic controls across its platform to protect personal
        information. CBS Uptime encrypts data it collects both in transit and at rest using strong
        encryption algorithms.</p>

    <p>ONEUPTIME HAS A TEAM OF PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROFESSIONALS DEDICATED TO OUR COMPLIANCE AND
        TO HELPING YOU MAINTAIN YOUR COMPLIANCE AND CONFIDENCE WHEN USING ONEUPTIME.</p>

    <p>shall Process Personal Information only in accordance with the documented
        instructions from Customer (as set out in this CDPA or the Agreement or as otherwise
        notified by Customer to CBS Uptime from time to time); provided CBS Uptime may Process
        Personal Information for Business Purposes under the CCPA or another applicable law

        This CDPA supplements the terms of the Agreement. In the event of any
        conflict between this CDPA and the Agreement regarding the processing of
        Consumers’ Personal Information, the terms of this CDPA shall control.</p>
